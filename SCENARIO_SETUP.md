# Creating a Driving Scenario
To create your own road scenario, you can update ```main()``` in ```t_rrt_time_varied.py``` or call your own instance of the T_RRT_TV class. This file summarizes ```main()``` in ```t_rrt_time_varied.py``` 

- ### Defining the map boundaries and properties:
  - Lines 377 through 384 define the overall map's time span, time step, and map bounds. 
  - ```lane_cost``` is the cost assigned to the lane lines. I usually assign a value of 0.35 to the lane lines.
  - ```children_per_node``` in line 383 is the number of children you allow each node to have. This acts as a "refinement control," and increasing the number of children allowed for each node will increase the amount of refinement in the tree, but will drastically increase run time. I normally keep this at either 1 or 2 children.
  - The ```initial_map``` is defined on line 386. This is the initial time layer (t=t0) which you define all initial vehicle conditions. 
  
- ### Adding objects to the map:
  - Lines 388 through 404 define the vehicles (car1-car3), lanes and barrier objects, with instructions outlined in COST_MAP_README.
  - These objects are inserted onto the ``` initial_map``` object.
  
- ### Creating a time-varied cost map
  - Line 406 defines ```map3d```, the CostMapWithTime object I will populate with CostMap layers.
  - The for loop at line 408 iterates through each time step.
    - It creates a temporary CostMap object (```temp_map``) in which it redefines the objects I defined in the ```initial_map``` object in lines 388 through 404.
    - lines 423 through 425 update the Vehicle objects' position and heading angles.
    - Line 427 appends the ```temp_map``` object.
    - Lines 430 through 433 update the Vehicle objects' speed and heading angle based on the trajectories given to me by Evan's vehicle motion files. These can be found in the ```/car_info``` directory.

- ### Running T_RRT_TV
  - Line 437 creates a TRRT_TV object.
  - In line 443 a path is created by calling the ```planning``` function.
  - Line 446 saves the CostMapWithTime object to a JSON file, at ```./out/path_information.txt```
  - The remaining code plots the final path generated by ```planning()```.

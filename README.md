# Time-Varying, Transition-Based, Rapidly-exploring Random Trees:
## General Overview:
- Starting velocity of the ego vechile is 10 m/s, with 0 m/s^2 acceleration
- The ego vehicle has the following constraints:
  - 70 degree steer range
  - 0.2 rad/s steer rate
  - (-8 to 4) m/s^2 acceleration
  - (15 to 27) m/s speed
  - Jerk and steer rate are minimized within the code

- Figures and media are located in ```./videos_and_images/```. Refer to the readme file within the folder for descriptions of each file.
- Information about the actor vehicles can be found in ``` ./car_info/```. Refer to the readme within the folder for a description of how to navigate through the folder.

## File Descriptions:
``` t_rrt_time_varied.py``` 
- Main file. Run this to aquire path information for the user-specified map and actor vehicles.
- Map, actors, and starting conditions may be adjusted in ```main()```
- Current map setup is identical to that of Evan's three-lane highway scenario

``` plot_path.py ```
- Plots the specified path over time.
- Allows you to visualize the path as the threat field changes with time.

``` actor_motion.py``` 
- Aquires actor motion information from ```./car_info/``` and returns their encoded velocity and heading angles

``` json_converter.py```
- Aquires JSON-formatted data generated in ```t_rrt_time_varied.py```
- Writes necessary ego vehicle path information to ```./car_info/car_0.txt``` for use with the Carla driving simulator

``` cost_map.py```
- Defines map, map layers, along with barriers, lanes, and vehicle objects.

```rrt.py```
- Unmodified RRT searching algorithm written by AtsushiSakai(@Atsushi_twi)

```t_rrt.py``` 
- Transition-based RRT searching algorithm with non-time varying threat field.


## Directories
``` ./out/```
- Location for path information and path image generated by ```t_rrt_time_varied.py```
  - **Note:** Remember to rename ```path_information.txt``` and ```path_output.png``` if you intend to save the most recent path information so it doesn't get overwritten.

``` ./saved_paths/```
- Various saved T-RRT-TV scenarios generated thoughout the development of the searching algorithm 
- May be visuallized by calling them in ```plot_path.py```

```./videos_and_images/```
- Various saved results generated throughout the development of the searching algorithm

``` ./car_info/```
- Contains ego and actor vehicle information for use in the Carla driving simulator

## Requirements
- Python 3.5

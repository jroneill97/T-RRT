========== Wednesday July 24th ==========
x- Convert system to rectangular bounds rather than square
o- Begin implimenting time-varying cost model to the system
o- Define goal so it just reaches the "end" of the highway frame
	- use a list of possible goals -> line 104 of t_rrt.py calculate the minimum distance d to use as that iteration's goal
o- Figure out how to stop from snaking between car and lane
	- could be to define an area around the current node which detects for cars?

========== Tuesday July 23rd ==========
o- Fix adjacency issue in MatLab
x- Incorporate minimum expansion control into T-RRT
x- Try to solve divide by 0 error in vehicle cost function
x- Define Barrier and Lanes

========== Monday July 22nd ==========
x- Get T-RRT "lite" to work without tuned Temperature or minimum expansion control
x- Define function to find map cost at point on map
	* Try to get minimum expansion control to work eventually since it minimizes computational demand

========== Friday July 19th ==========
x- Define way to incorporate cost into graph rather than just objects
	x- Add vehicle cost
	x- Incorporate cost into Node object
^- Get T-RRT "lite" to work without tuned Temperature or minimum expansion control
	* Try to get minimum expansion control to work eventually since it minimizes computational demand

========== Thursday July 18th ==========
^- Define way to incorporate cost into graph rather than just objects
x- Determine where adjacency is defined within RRTStar code
^- Get T-RRT "lite" to work without tuned Temperature or minimum expansion control
	* Try to get minimum expansion control to work eventually since it minimizes computational demand

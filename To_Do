========== Friday August 2nd ==========
o- Update animation type so a car object follows path
o- Output path and scenario information to a text file

========== Thursday August 1st ==========
^- Update animation type so a car object follows path
x- Specifying end heading angle?

========== Wednesday July 31th ==========
x- Finish implimenting acceleration and steer rate constraints
x- Clean up find_near_nodes()
*- Do we want a free or specified final heading?

========== Tuesday July 30th ==========
x- Find out why path skips to goal when vehicle is in front
^- Add acceleration and angular rate constraints

========== Monday July 29th ==========
x- Finish adding time dimension
x- Find a way to allow any end time (any t in t_array on goal point)
	* could relate to allowing range of positions as end goal
^- Impliment kinematic constraints

========== Friday July 26th ==========
^- Impliment min/max accel and speed to steer function
	- The min/max speed constraint seems to be incorrect
x- change plot type
~- Move vehicle_collision function to a more intuitive class

========== Thursday July 25th ==========
x- Begin implimenting time-varying cost model to the system
	x- time updated externally or internally?
	^- RRT with kinematic constraints
^- Move vehicle_collision function to a more intuitive class
~- Begin to clean up code

========== Wednesday July 24th ==========
x- Convert system to rectangular bounds rather than square
^- Begin implimenting time-varying cost model to the system
~- Define goal so it just reaches the "end" of the highway frame
	- use a list of possible goals -> line 104 of t_rrt.py calculate the minimum distance d to use as that iteration's goal
o- Figure out how to stop from snaking between car and lane
	- could be to define an area around the current node which detects for cars?

========== Tuesday July 23rd ==========
o- Fix adjacency issue in MatLab
x- Incorporate minimum expansion control into T-RRT
x- Try to solve divide by 0 error in vehicle cost function
x- Define Barrier and Lanes

========== Monday July 22nd ==========
x- Get T-RRT "lite" to work without tuned Temperature or minimum expansion control
x- Define function to find map cost at point on map
	* Try to get minimum expansion control to work eventually since it minimizes computational demand

========== Friday July 19th ==========
x- Define way to incorporate cost into graph rather than just objects
	x- Add vehicle cost
	x- Incorporate cost into Node object
^- Get T-RRT "lite" to work without tuned Temperature or minimum expansion control
	* Try to get minimum expansion control to work eventually since it minimizes computational demand

========== Thursday July 18th ==========
^- Define way to incorporate cost into graph rather than just objects
x- Determine where adjacency is defined within RRTStar code
^- Get T-RRT "lite" to work without tuned Temperature or minimum expansion control
	* Try to get minimum expansion control to work eventually since it minimizes computational demand
